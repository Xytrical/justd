## Section Title
Sometimes, you may only need a card header without wrapping container itself. Of course, you need don't want the default padding, right? So I have prop called `withoutPadding` to help you out.
```
<CardHeader
  title="List Daemons"
  description="List of daemons to use in your sites."
/>
```

## Adjust Padding

The padding for all sections of the card—header, content, and footer—is controlled by a CSS variable defined on the card’s parent container. To update the padding for the entire card, simply set the variable via a class on the parent like this:

```
<Card className='[--card-spacing:--spacing(2)'/>
```
