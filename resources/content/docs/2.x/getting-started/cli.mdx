## Command Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI is designed to help you set up your project with Intent quickly and efficiently. It’s the easiest and most convenient way to install Intent, allowing you to get started with your project in just minutes.

## Existing Project
If you already have a project set up—whether it’s built with Laravel, Next.js, Remix, Tanstack, or any other framework—simply run the following command to install Intent:
<Installation options={{ isInit: true }} items={['initial setup']} />
This command will prompt you to confirm your project’s setup. However, the CLI is smart enough to detect your project type and provide default values.

## Start a New Project
The CLI is highly flexible and can automatically detect whether you already have a project set up. If you don’t, you can start fresh by running the `init` command like this:
<Installation options={{ isInit: true }} items={['initial setup']} />

## Add
Once you’ve set up Intent, you can start adding components easily by running the `add` command:
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true, noText: true }} items={['combo-box']} />

## Diff
If you think your Intent setup might be outdated, don’t worry. You can check for changes by running the `diff` command:
<Installation options={{isExecutor: true}} command='npx @intentui/cli@latest diff' items={['']} />

This will display the components that differ from your installed versions and provide a list so you can quickly choose which components to update.

## Alias
If you’re tired of typing `npx @intentui/cli@latest`, you can create an alias for the CLI by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
```
alias intentui='npx @intentui/cli@latest'
```
Then you can run the CLI using the `intentui` command:
```
intentui [command]
```

## Shadcn CLI
You might notice that we provide our own CLI, but if you prefer using the ShadCN CLI, that's totally fine. To get started, initialize your application with the following command:

<Installation options={{ isComponent: false, noText: true }} command='npx shadcn@latest init https://intentui.com/r/style/default' />

It currently offers 5 starter styles, including `blue`, `indigo`, `emerald`, and `sky`, so you can replace `default` with any style you prefer.

Once initialized, you can add components by running:
<Installation options={{ isComponent: false, noText: true }} command='npx shadcn@latest add https://intentui.com/r/ui/<component>' />

Let’s say you want to add a card component. Just replace `<component>` with `card`, like this:

<Installation options={{ isComponent: false, noText: true }} command='npx shadcn@latest add https://intentui.com/r/ui/card' />
