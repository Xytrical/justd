## Checkbox Icon
The checkbox icon now uses `size-3.5` instead of `size-4`, and includes a new `data-slot="checkbox-indicator"` attribute to clearly identify the indicator element.

## Choicebox Revamp
Previously, you might have defined your items like this:
```tsx
<Choicebox.Item title="Basic" description="Just the essentials to get started." />
```

We’ve now updated the API and renamed the `title` prop to `label`.
This change helps avoid conflicts with the default `title` attribute in HTML, which can trigger unwanted browser tooltips. By using `label` instead, the behavior is more predictable and easier to control.
Here’s the new syntax:

```tsx
<Choicebox.Item label="Basic" description="Just the essentials to get started." /> // ✅
```

If you want to include an icon or avatar, it’s now much easier. You can use the new children structure: `Choicebox.Label` and `Choicebox.Description`.

```tsx
<Choicebox.Item textValue={item.id}>
  <Choicebox.Label>{item.label}</Choicebox.Label>
  <Choicebox.Description>{item.description}</Choicebox.Description>
</Choicebox.Item>
```

You can still use `label` and `description` directly like before. But with this new structure, you can also include avatars or icons alongside them.

```tsx
<Choicebox.Item textValue={item.id}>
  <Avatar src={item.image_url} />
  <Choicebox.Label>{item.label}</Choicebox.Label>
  <Choicebox.Description>{item.description}</Choicebox.Description>
</Choicebox.Item>
```
Another design improvement is that Choicebox now uses `grid-cols-subgrid` to ensure content alignment when `columns={1}` is set.

## Dropdown Description

A new child component has been added to `Dropdown` called `DropdownDescription`.

We introduced this to make it easier to customize the dropdown content. For example, you can now include icons or any other elements alongside the description.

```
import { IconMinus } from "@intentui/icons"

<DropdownItem>
  <IconMinus />
  <DropdownLabel>Item</DropdownLabel>
  <DropdownDescription>Item description</DropdownDescription>
</DropdownItem>
```

## Removing `DropdownItemDetails`

The old `DropdownItemDetails` component was useful but hard to customize. That's why it has been removed. Instead, every component now supports a `Description` element, which provides more flexibility.

Here are examples of other components that now support descriptions inside dropdown items:

```tsx
// Menu
<Menu.Item textValue="Admin">
  <Menu.Label>Admin</Menu.Label>
  <Menu.Description>Has full access to all resources</Menu.Description>
</Menu.Item>

// Select
<Select.Option textValue="Admin">
  <Select.Label>Admin</Select.Label>
  <Select.Description>Has full access to all resources</Select.Description>
</Select.Option>
```

## ComboBox Description

With `DropdownDescription` now available, `ComboBox` items can also include descriptions in the same way.

```tsx
<ComboBox.Option textValue="Admin">
  <ComboBox.Label>Admin</ComboBox.Label>
  <ComboBox.Description>Has full access to all resources</ComboBox.Description>
</ComboBox.Option>
```

## Migration Note for `DropdownItemDetails` Users

If you previously used `DropdownItemDetails`, you’ll need to update your code. This component has been removed to allow more flexibility and better customization.

Replace any usage of:

```tsx
<Dropdown.ItemDetails />
```

with a more customizable structure using `DropdownLabel` and `DropdownDescription`:

```tsx
<DropdownItem>
  <IconMinus />
  <DropdownLabel>Item</DropdownLabel>
  <DropdownDescription>Item description</DropdownDescription>
</DropdownItem>
```

This new approach makes it easier to add icons, avatars, or any other custom content directly inside your dropdown items.

## Refactor Table
The table component has been significantly refactored and now supports a new `bleed` prop, which is `false` by default. Check out an example in [Sidebar 15](/blocks/sidebar/sidebar-15), and as always, refer to the table documentation [here](/docs/components/collections/table).


## Small change to sidebar
When your table has a large number of columns, the layout usually breaks. But now, you can add as many columns as you want and it’ll still look great. [Sidebar 15](/blocks/sidebar/sidebar-15).

## Documentation Updates
- You can now pull any demo directly using the CLI.
- And yes — it’s our most requested feature: you can now open it with v0.

## Navbar
The intent value `floating` is now renamed to `float` to stay consistent with other values.
